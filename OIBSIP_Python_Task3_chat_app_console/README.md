Two User Chat Application (Python Console-Based)
>>Project Description
-This project is a console-based two-user chat application developed using Python.
-The application allows two users to communicate with each other by sending text messages through the command-line interface.
-The chat works in a turn-based manner, where one user sends a message and the other user replies.
-Each message is recorded along with the current date and time, ensuring that the conversation history is properly maintained.
-The application also provides options to view previous messages, continue chatting, save the chat history to a file, or exit the program.
-This project is developed using basic Python concepts and is suitable for beginners and internship-level practice.
