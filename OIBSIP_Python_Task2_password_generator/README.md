PASSWORD GENERATOR(Python console-based)
>>Project Overview
This is a console-based Password Generator application developed using Python.
The program allows users to generate passwords based on selected strength levels (Weak, Medium, Strong) using a simple menu-driven interface.
The project is designed for beginners to understand basic Python concepts such as:
→ user input
→ conditional statements
→ loops
→ functions
→ random module usage

>>Features
-Menu-driven interface
-Generate passwords multiple times in one run
-User-defined password length
-Password strength options:
 Weak
 Medium
 Strong (Recommended)
-Security awareness messages for weak passwords
-Clean and simple console output

>>Password Strength Logic
Weak: Contains only alphabets
⚠️ Warning message shown for security awareness
Medium: Contains alphabets and numbers
Strong: Contains alphabets, numbers, and symbols
✅ Recommended for better security
Note: Weak passwords are included for learning purposes only. Strong passwords are recommended.

>>Technologies Used
Language: Python
Module: random
Interface: Command Line (Console)
